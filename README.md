# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Analyze Amazon reviews that were written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and record any biases toward favorable reviews from Vine members on them, if any for the Video Game products available. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies such as SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review and we want to ensure we are putting the best information out there for the consumer market.

## Summary: 
In the case of this analysis, the total percentage of 5 star reviews is 39%. The large percentage of 5 star reviews, 38%, by Vine members, indicates the possibility of positivity bias. Positivity bias by definition, _*"Positivity bias may denote three phenomena: a tendency for people to report positive views of reality; a tendency to hold positive expectations, views, and memories; and a tendency to favor positive information in reasoning."_ Even though both 5 star percentages are similar, 39% of non-Vine reviews are five star and 38% of reviews by Vine members, both Vine members and non-Vine members may be influenced by positivity bias. As an example, if you have a view of a video game as being great, but could use some improvements, let's consider this a 4 star rating. When going to submit your review, you see the higher amount of 5 star versus 4 star ratings, psycologically this is likely to cause change to your initial review based on other submissions.

Another analysis I would recommend conducting would be if there are any duplicate reviewers. By this, I am questioning if there is an ability for a reviewer to leave multiple reviews for the same products. This in turn, gives us false total review figures. If there could be a way to aid in filtering that possibility when attempting to leave a review, along with the ability of hiding the current reviews when posting, I believe we would have a better and perhaps more realistic figures for ratings overall.
